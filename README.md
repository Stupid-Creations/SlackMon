# SlackMon

## Play Pokemon, in Slack!

A Slack Bot which plays pokemon. It uses pyboy to simulate pokemon, using User inputs in a channel of your choice to enter inputs, and sends a picture of the game-state in the channel!
Also logs all inputs because why not, random numbers are cool.

## User Inputs:
- I: Up
- J: Left
- K: Down
- L: Right
- A: A
- B: B
- LOOP: Loops for a given number of frames, and presses any key each frame if given. (i.e. LOOP 5 A presses A 5 times)
This is currently rather janky as this was my first time making a slack bot, so use at your own discretion
